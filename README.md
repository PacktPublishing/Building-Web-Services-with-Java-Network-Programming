This is the code repository for [Building Web Services with Java Network Programming [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/networking-and-servers/building-web-services-java-network-programming-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788629614), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Web services drive networking on the web and have been at the center of modern application architecture. Regardless of language or platform, understanding how web services work is a serious skill. This course explores web services: the concepts, commands, and tools that allow you to communicate and share data between applications.

You will learn how to use HTTP services in synchronous and asynchronous modes by configuring an HTTP client. You will also explore protocols such as SOAP, and REST and shares simple programming tips for writing web services that are as efficient as possible. Plus, you'll learn how to secure your communications across the web with security standards and create key-store and server applications that use symmetric and asymmetric encryption for client and server.

By the end of this video tutorial you will be equipped to handle WebSocket functionality supported by servlets in Java and will have mastered advanced concepts well enough to build web services, ensuring the audience is able to understand and secure network applications through encryption and by interfacing with other languages.
